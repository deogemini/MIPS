I'm always frustrated when a member of parliament wants to replay on posted compliment how will make it and to viewed at the same time by the citizen loggin the system.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
I would like after at the page of a member of parliament compliments to be viewed with the input for the replay and button to send the feedback

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Another approach is to view all compliments and to select one to replay where the replay body will pop up and used by a member of parliament.

**Additional context**
this feature may provide and timestamp of posted compliment and timestamp for the feedback
